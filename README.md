## **Part 1: Initial Sitemap and Wireframe**

### **Requirements**

1. **Sitemap (Figma):**  
   - Use Figma (or a similar tool) to create a **sitemap** of your current personal website.  
   - Clearly show all main pages, subpages, and how they link together.

2. **Wireframe (Figma):**  
   - Create a **wireframe** of your personal website’s **current** layout.  
   - Include all major sections (header, main content areas, footer, etc.).  
   - Focus on structure, not final design. Do not worry about colors, imagery, or interactive elements at this stage.

3. **Clarity and Legibility:**  
   - Ensure your Figma drawings are clear, neatly labeled, and easy to understand.  
   - Your sitemap should accurately reflect how users navigate your site, and your wireframe should match your site’s existing structure.

## **Part 2: Updated Sitemap and Wireframe**

### **Requirements**

1. **Refine Your Sitemap:**  
   - Identify any changes or improvements to your site’s structure.

2. **Improve Your Wireframe:**  
   - Based on your refined sitemap, update the wireframe to reflect any structural changes.  
   - Address potential usability or navigation issues.  
   - Show where major content blocks or features might be repositioned for better user flow.

3. **Figma Setup:**  
   - Keep your **updated sitemap** and **updated wireframe** organized in Figma.

## **Tips**

1. **Focus on Structure, Not Aesthetics:**  
   - Wireframes are about layout and hierarchy. Keep them simple and avoid color or decorative elements at this stage.

2. **Reflect Real User Flow:**  
   - Your sitemap should mimic how users will realistically navigate your website.

3. **Keep Updating:**  
   - If you discover new ideas or improvements while creating your wireframe, don’t hesitate to revise your sitemap accordingly.

4. **Figma Organization:**  
   - Use frames, layers, and labels in Figma to keep your work tidy and easy to read.
