# **Exercise 3: Sitemaps and Wireframes**

**Due Date:** February 10, 2025 (in lab or by the end of the day)  
**Total Marks:** 100  

---

## **Objective**

In this exercise, you will create and refine a **sitemap** and **wireframe** for your existing personal website. Additionally, you will write a short reflection describing the **issues** you have discovered in your current site’s hierarchy and visual organization, and **explain** how you plan to address them using alignment, scale, Gestalt principles, and other design concepts learned in class.

## **Part 1: Initial Sitemap and Wireframe**

### **Requirements**

1. **Sitemap (Figma):**  
   - Use Figma (or a similar tool) to create a **sitemap** of your **current** personal website.  
   - Clearly show all main pages, subpages, and how they connect.

2. **Wireframe (Figma):**  
   - Create a **wireframe** of your personal website’s **current** layout.  
   - Include all major sections (header, main content areas, footer, etc.).  
   - Focus on structure, not final design.  
   - Do **not** worry about colors, images, or interactive elements at this stage.

3. **Clarity and Legibility:**  
   - Ensure your Figma drawings are clear, neatly labeled, and easy to understand.  
   - Your sitemap should accurately reflect how users navigate your site, and your wireframe should match your site’s existing structure.

## **Part 2: Updated Sitemap and Wireframe**

### **Requirements**

1. **Refine Your Sitemap:**  
   - Identify any **changes or improvements** to your site’s structure.  
   - Update your sitemap accordingly (e.g., reorganize pages, combine redundant sections, rename pages for clarity).

2. **Improve Your Wireframe:**  
   - Based on your **refined sitemap**, update the wireframe to reflect any structural changes.  
   - Address potential **usability** or **navigation** issues.  
   - Demonstrate how you will use alignment, scale, or other design principles for a clearer user experience.

3. **Figma Setup:**  
   - Keep your **updated sitemap** and **updated wireframe** organized in Figma.  
   - Clearly label both as “Updated Sitemap” and “Updated Wireframe.”

## **Part 3: Reflective Analysis (1-2 Paragraphs)**

### **Requirements**

1. **Identify Website Issues:**  
   - In **one or two paragraphs**, describe the **problems** you noticed in your original website regarding:  
     - **Hierarchy** (e.g., how pages and subpages are organized, ease of navigation).  
     - **Visual Elements** (e.g., alignment, scale of text or images, clutter, lack of clear signifiers).  

2. **Explain Proposed Changes:**  
   - Clearly **justify** why you propose these changes based on **class concepts**:  
     - **Alignment and Scale**: Are elements aligned consistently? Is text sized appropriately to convey hierarchy?  
     - **Gestalt Principles** (e.g., proximity, similarity): How can grouping or spacing improve readability?  
     - **Readability and Paragraph Organization**: Are paragraphs or sections too dense? Is white space used effectively?  
     - **Affordances and Signifiers**: Are interactive elements obvious? Are buttons/links distinguishable?  
   - Provide a brief rationale for how each change will enhance user experience or clarity.

## **Marking Rubric (100 Marks)**

| **Criteria**                      | **0%** | **25%** | **50%** | **75%** | **100%** | **Marks** |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Initial Sitemap & Wireframe (Part 1)** | Not submitted or off-topic. | Sitemap and wireframe are incomplete or difficult to interpret. | Sitemap and wireframe are mostly complete but missing some key elements. | Sitemap and wireframe include all major elements with minor issues. | Sitemap and wireframe fully document the website’s structure, clearly labeled and well-organized. | 30 |
| **Updated Sitemap & Wireframe (Part 2)** | No updates or changes made. | Minimal updates, does not address major issues. | Some improvements evident, but structure is still unclear. | Significant improvements made to navigation and organization. | Sitemap and wireframe show thoughtful, well-implemented improvements with excellent user flow. | 30 |
| **Reflective Analysis (Part 3)** | No reflection included. | Reflection is vague or lacks sufficient detail. | Reflection identifies some issues but does not fully connect them to class concepts. | Reflection provides clear discussion of site issues and partially explains how class concepts informed improvements. | Reflection is thorough, well-connected to specific class concepts (alignment, scale, Gestalt, etc.), and fully justifies proposed changes. | 40 |

## **Tips**

1. **Focus on Structure, Not Aesthetics:**  
   - Wireframes are about layout and hierarchy. Keep them simple and avoid distracting visuals.

2. **Reflect Real User Flow:**  
   - Your sitemap should mimic how users will realistically navigate your website.

3. **Use Class Concepts:**  
   - Reference alignment, scale, Gestalt principles, readability, affordances, and signifiers to justify your changes.

4. **Figma Organization:**  
   - Use frames, layers, and labels in Figma to keep your work tidy and easy to read.
